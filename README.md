# Automated-VA
Need Nmap to be installed in the system.
Rest other script it will download automatically.

This script can take any file as argument where you can provide a list of ip.Every IP in different lines.
So lets say the file containing list of IP is stored as list.
Now execute ./automate.sh list.

Note: We recommend a kali machine for this script to run smoothly.
